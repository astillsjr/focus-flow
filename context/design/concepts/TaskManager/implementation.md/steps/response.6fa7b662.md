## TaskManager: A Concept Design Approach

A TaskManager application is a perfect candidate for concept design, as its core functionalities are naturally modular and reusable. By breaking down the application into distinct, independently understandable *concepts*, we can achieve greater clarity, robustness, and reusability. This design aims to manage tasks, assign them to users, and set due dates, while adhering to the principles of concept independence and separation of concerns.

The TaskManager will be built upon the following core concepts:

* **Task**: Manages the fundamental properties and lifecycle of a task item.
* **Assignment**: Handles the association of tasks with specific users.
* **DueDate**: Manages the deadlines for tasks.
* **TaskManagerRequest**: A pseudo-concept representing user-initiated actions, which are then processed by *syncs* to interact with the core concepts.
* **Session**: An assumed concept (as in the example) for identifying authenticated users.

### Concepts

#### 1. Task Concept

* **Purpose**: To manage the core properties (description, completion status) and lifecycle (creation, modification, deletion) of a task item. It ensures a task's fundamental attributes are coherent and independently manageable.
* **State**: The `Task` concept maintains information about `Task` objects.
  * `tasks`: A collection of `Task` objects, each uniquely identified by `task_id`.
  * For each `Task` object, it holds:
    * `task_id`: A unique identifier.
    * `description`: A textual summary of the task.
    * `is_complete`: A boolean indicating if the task has been finished.
    * `creator_id`: The identifier of the `User` who created the task, maintaining a relationship between `Task` objects and `User` objects.
* **Actions**:
  * `create (task_id, description, creator_id)`: Creates a new task with the given details.
  * `update_description (task_id, new_description)`: Modifies the description of an existing task.
  * `mark_complete (task_id)`: Sets the `is_complete` status of a task to true.
  * `mark_incomplete (task_id)`: Sets the `is_complete` status of a task to false.
  * `delete (task_id)`: Removes a task from the system.

#### 2. Assignment Concept

* **Purpose**: To manage the association of `Task` objects with `User` objects, allowing tasks to be assigned to individuals. Its purpose is solely to establish and manage this relationship.
* **State**: The `Assignment` concept maintains information about `Assignment` objects.
  * `assignments`: A collection of `Assignment` objects, each uniquely identified by `assignment_id`.
  * For each `Assignment` object, it holds:
    * `assignment_id`: A unique identifier for the assignment record.
    * `task_id`: The identifier of the `Task` object being assigned, maintaining a relationship between `Assignment` objects and `Task` objects.
    * `assignee_id`: The identifier of the `User` object to whom the task is assigned, maintaining a relationship between `Assignment` objects and `User` objects.
* **Actions**:
  * `assign (assignment_id, task_id, assignee_id)`: Creates a new assignment record, linking a specific task to a specific user.
  * `unassign (assignment_id)`: Removes an existing assignment record.
  * `reassign (assignment_id, new_assignee_id)`: Changes the user assigned to an existing task assignment.

#### 3. DueDate Concept

* **Purpose**: To manage the specific deadlines associated with tasks. It ensures that due date information is handled separately and consistently.
* **State**: The `DueDate` concept maintains information about `DueDate` objects.
  * `due_dates`: A collection of `DueDate` objects, each uniquely identified by `duedate_id`.
  * For each `DueDate` object, it holds:
    * `duedate_id`: A unique identifier for the due date record.
    * `task_id`: The identifier of the `Task` object to which the due date applies, maintaining a relationship between `DueDate` objects and `Task` objects.
    * `date_time`: The specific date and time representing the deadline.
* **Actions**:
  * `set (duedate_id, task_id, date_time)`: Creates or updates a due date for a specific task.
  * `clear (duedate_id)`: Removes the due date record for a task.

#### 4. TaskManagerRequest Concept (Pseudo-Concept)

* **Purpose**: To serve as the entry point for user interactions with the TaskManager application. It represents the immediate user request before any business logic or authorization is applied.
* **State**: (Implicit/transient, representing the request parameters).
* **Actions**:
  * `createTask (request_id, description, session_id)`: User requests to create a task.
  * `updateTaskDescription (request_id, task_id, new_description, session_id)`: User requests to change a task's description.
  * `completeTask (request_id, task_id, session_id)`: User requests to mark a task as complete.
  * `incompleteTask (request_id, task_id, session_id)`: User requests to mark a task as incomplete.
  * `deleteTask (request_id, task_id, session_id)`: User requests to delete a task.
  * `assignTask (request_id, task_id, assignee_id, session_id)`: User requests to assign a task to another user.
  * `setTaskDueDate (request_id, task_id, date_time, session_id)`: User requests to set a due date for a task.

### Composition by Synchronization

Because concepts are independent, they do not directly call each other. Instead, their behaviors are coordinated through `syncs`. These `syncs` define rules for how actions in one concept can trigger actions in another, often based on conditions in the state of various concepts. They also handle authorization by checking user identity via the `Session` concept.

(Assumed: `Session` concept exists as described in the prompt, mapping `session_id` to `user_id`.)

#### Examples of Syncs for TaskManager

Here are some syncs demonstrating how the TaskManager functionality is composed:

**1. Create a Task**
This sync processes a user's request to create a task, verifying the user's session and then invoking the `Task.create` action.

```
sync CreateTaskFromRequest
when
    TaskManagerRequest.createTask (req_id, description, s_id)
where
    in Session: user of session s_id is u // Ensure user is authenticated
then
    Task.create (new_task_id, description, u) // new_task_id is generated uniquely
```

**2. Update a Task's Description**
Only the creator of a task is allowed to update its description.

```
sync UpdateTaskDescriptionFromRequest
when
    TaskManagerRequest.updateTaskDescription (req_id, t_id, new_desc, s_id)
where
    in Session: user of session s_id is u
    in Task: creator of t_id is u // Authorization: only task creator can update
then
    Task.update_description (t_id, new_desc)
```

**3. Mark a Task as Complete**
A task can be marked complete by its creator or its assignee.

```
sync CompleteTaskFromRequest
when
    TaskManagerRequest.completeTask (req_id, t_id, s_id)
where
    in Session: user of session s_id is u
    (
        in Task: creator of t_id is u
        OR
        in Assignment: task of a_id is t_id AND assignee of a_id is u
    ) // Authorization: creator or assignee can complete
then
    Task.mark_complete (t_id)
```

**4. Mark a Task as Incomplete**
Similar to completing, a task can be marked incomplete by its creator or its assignee.

```
sync IncompleteTaskFromRequest
when
    TaskManagerRequest.incompleteTask (req_id, t_id, s_id)
where
    in Session: user of session s_id is u
    (
        in Task: creator of t_id is u
        OR
        in Assignment: task of a_id is t_id AND assignee of a_id is u
    ) // Authorization: creator or assignee can mark incomplete
then
    Task.mark_incomplete (t_id)
```

**5. Delete a Task and Cascade Deletions**
When a task is deleted, it should also remove any associated assignments and due dates. Only the creator can delete the task.

```
sync DeleteTaskFromRequest
when
    TaskManagerRequest.deleteTask (req_id, t_id, s_id)
where
    in Session: user of session s_id is u
    in Task: creator of t_id is u // Authorization: only task creator can delete
then
    Task.delete (t_id)
```

```
sync CascadeDeleteAssignmentsForTask
when
    Task.delete (t_id) // Action from the Task concept
where
    in Assignment: task of a_id is t_id // Find all assignments for this task
then
    Assignment.unassign (a_id)
```

```
sync CascadeDeleteDueDatesForTask
when
    Task.delete (t_id) // Action from the Task concept
where
    in DueDate: task of dd_id is t_id // Find all due dates for this task
then
    DueDate.clear (dd_id)
```

**6. Assign a Task**
Only the creator of a task can assign it to another user.

```
sync AssignTaskFromRequest
when
    TaskManagerRequest.assignTask (req_id, t_id, assignee_id, s_id)
where
    in Session: user of session s_id is u
    in Task: creator of t_id is u // Authorization: only task creator can assign
    // (Optional: additional 'where' clause to ensure assignee_id corresponds to a valid user in a User concept)
then
    Assignment.assign (new_assignment_id, t_id, assignee_id) // new_assignment_id generated uniquely
```

**7. Set a Task's Due Date**
Only the creator of a task can set its due date.

```
sync SetTaskDueDateFromRequest
when
    TaskManagerRequest.setTaskDueDate (req_id, t_id, date_time, s_id)
where
    in Session: user of session s_id is u
    in Task: creator of t_id is u // Authorization: only task creator can set due date
then
    DueDate.set (new_duedate_id, t_id, date_time) // new_duedate_id generated uniquely
```

This concept design for a TaskManager demonstrates how granular, reusable units of functionality can be defined and then composed into a complete application through explicit synchronization rules, enhancing modularity, clarity, and maintainability.
