# response:

Okay, let's implement the `TaskManager` concept according to the principles outlined in the provided document.

***

## Concept: TaskManager

**Purpose:**
The `TaskManager` concept provides a dedicated, reusable unit of functionality for organizing, tracking, and managing individual units of work (tasks). Its core purpose is to maintain the lifecycle and state of tasks, including their creation, assignment, scheduling, and completion, without conflating concerns related to users, notifications, or other domain-specific aspects.

**State:**
The `TaskManager` concept maintains a collection of `Task` objects. Each `Task` object represents a distinct unit of work and holds the following properties and relationships:

* **`id`**: A unique identifier for the task (e.g., a UUID or application-specific ID). This ID is opaque to the `TaskManager` concept itself, allowing for polymorphism.
* **`description`**: A textual string that provides details or instructions for the task.
* **`status`**: The current completion status of the task. This is an enumerated value:
  * `PENDING`: The task is active and has not yet been completed.
  * `COMPLETED`: The task has been finished.
* **`creator_id`**: An identifier for the user who initiated or created the task. This is an abstract user ID; `TaskManager` makes no assumptions about the user's name, authentication status, or other attributes.
* **`assignee_id`**: An optional identifier for the user currently responsible for performing the task. Like `creator_id`, this is an abstract user ID. It can be `null` if the task is unassigned.
* **`due_date`**: An optional timestamp indicating the deadline by which the task is expected to be completed. Can be `null` if no deadline is set.
* **`completed_date`**: An optional timestamp recording when the task was marked as `COMPLETED`. This is `null` if the task is `PENDING`.

**Actions:**
The `TaskManager` concept defines a set of atomic actions that allow users and (via synchronizations) other systems to interact with and modify the state of tasks.

* **User-Initiated Actions:**

  * **`createTask(taskId: ID, description: String, creatorId: ID)`**
    * **Purpose:** To bring a new task into existence.
    * **Effect:** Creates a new `Task` record in the concept's state. The `id` is set to `taskId`, `description` to `description`, `creator_id` to `creatorId`. `status` is initialized to `PENDING`. `assignee_id`, `due_date`, and `completed_date` are set to `null`.
  * **`assignTask(taskId: ID, assigneeId: ID)`**
    * **Purpose:** To designate a specific user as responsible for a task.
    * **Effect:** Updates the `assignee_id` of the `Task` identified by `taskId` to `assigneeId`.
  * **`unassignTask(taskId: ID)`**
    * **Purpose:** To remove the current assignee from a task.
    * **Effect:** Sets the `assignee_id` of the `Task` identified by `taskId` to `null`.
  * **`setDueDate(taskId: ID, dueDate: Timestamp)`**
    * **Purpose:** To establish a deadline for a task.
    * **Effect:** Updates the `due_date` of the `Task` identified by `taskId` to `dueDate`.
  * **`clearDueDate(taskId: ID)`**
    * **Purpose:** To remove a previously set deadline.
    * **Effect:** Sets the `due_date` of the `Task` identified by `taskId` to `null`.
  * **`completeTask(taskId: ID)`**
    * **Purpose:** To mark a task as finished.
    * **Effect:** Changes the `status` of the `Task` identified by `taskId` to `COMPLETED` and sets its `completed_date` to the current timestamp.
  * **`reopenTask(taskId: ID)`**
    * **Purpose:** To revert a completed task back to an active, pending state.
    * **Effect:** Changes the `status` of the `Task` identified by `taskId` to `PENDING` and sets its `completed_date` to `null`.
  * **`updateTaskDescription(taskId: ID, newDescription: String)`**
    * **Purpose:** To modify the descriptive text of a task.
    * **Effect:** Updates the `description` of the `Task` identified by `taskId` to `newDescription`.
  * **`deleteTask(taskId: ID)`**
    * **Purpose:** To permanently remove a task from the system.
    * **Effect:** Deletes the `Task` object identified by `taskId` from the concept's state.

* **Output Actions (Spontaneous):**

  * **`taskBecameOverdue(taskId: ID)`**
    * **Purpose:** To signal internally that a `PENDING` task with a `due_date` has passed its deadline.
    * **Effect:** This action occurs spontaneously, under the concept's internal control, when the current system time surpasses the `due_date` of a `PENDING` task. It represents a significant state change recognized by the `TaskManager` concept, which can then be used by synchronizations to trigger further actions (e.g., sending a notification via a `Notification` concept). The `TaskManager` itself does not send external messages, but it does emit this internal event.

**API Specification / Human Behavioral Protocol:**

* **API Specification (Backend Service Perspective):**
  The `TaskManager` concept would typically be implemented as a backend service exposing an API.
  * `POST /tasks` (for `createTask`)
  * `PUT /tasks/{taskId}/assign` (for `assignTask`)
  * `PUT /tasks/{taskId}/complete` (for `completeTask`)
  * `DELETE /tasks/{taskId}` (for `deleteTask`)
  * ...and similar endpoints for all other actions.
    The `taskBecameOverdue` action would manifest as a system-generated event or message that other services/syncs can subscribe to or observe.

* **Human Behavioral Protocol (User Perspective):**
  "I can create a new task and give it a description. I can then assign this task to myself or another team member, and set a specific due date. As work progresses, I can update the task's description. Once the task is finished, I can mark it as complete, and if circumstances change, I can reopen it. If a task passes its deadline while still pending, the system recognizes this as being overdue. I also have the option to delete a task if it's no longer relevant."

**Independence and Polymorphism:**
The `TaskManager` concept embodies strong independence. It operates exclusively with abstract `ID`s for tasks, creators, and assignees. It makes no assumptions about the nature, attributes, or authentication status of these entities beyond their unique identification. This design ensures that `TaskManager` can be seamlessly reused across diverse applications, regardless of how `User` or other domain objects are defined elsewhere. The `taskId`, `creatorId`, and `assigneeId` are treated as opaque, generic identifiers.

**Separation of Concerns:**
`TaskManager` adheres strictly to its single, coherent concern: managing the lifecycle and state of tasks. It consciously avoids conflating responsibilities such as user authentication, user profile management, or external communication (like sending email or SMS notifications). These separate functionalities would reside within distinct concepts (e.g., `UserAuthentication`, `Profile`, `Notification`, etc.) and would interact with `TaskManager` solely through explicitly defined synchronizations.

**Completeness of Functionality:**
Within its defined scope of task management, `TaskManager` is self-contained and complete. It encapsulates all necessary logic to perform its actions and maintain its state without relying on other concepts to execute partial steps of its core functionality. For instance, the act of "completing a task" is fully handled within `TaskManager` and does not require calling out to another concept to finalize the completion process.

**Example Synchronizations (for illustration purposes, these are NOT part of the `TaskManager` concept's definition but demonstrate its integration):**

1. **Notify Assignee When Task is Assigned:**
   ```
   sync NotifyOnTaskAssignment
   when
       TaskManager.assignTask (task_id, assignee_id)
   where
       // Verify the assignment
       in TaskManager: task (id: task_id, assignee: assignee_id)
   then
       Notification.send (
           recipient_id = assignee_id,
           subject = "New Task Assignment: " + TaskManager.description (task_id),
           message = "You have been assigned the task: '" + TaskManager.description (task_id) + "'. It is due by " + TaskManager.due_date (task_id) + "."
       )
   ```

2. **Send Reminder When Task Becomes Overdue:**
   ```
   sync SendOverdueReminder
   when
       TaskManager.taskBecameOverdue (task_id)
   where
       in TaskManager: task (id: task_id, status: PENDING, assignee: assignee_id)
   then
       Notification.send (
           recipient_id = assignee_id,
           subject = "Task Overdue: " + TaskManager.description (task_id),
           message = "The task '" + TaskManager.description (task_id) + "' is now overdue. Please complete it as soon as possible."
       )
   ```

3. **Prevent Non-Assignee from Completing a Task:**
   ```
   sync AuthorizeTaskCompletionByAssignee
   when
       Request.completeTask (task_id, session_id) // A user, identified by session, requests to complete task
   where
       in Session: user (session_id: session_id, user_id: request_user_id)
       in TaskManager: task (id: task_id, assignee: request_user_id, status: PENDING)
   then
       TaskManager.completeTask (task_id)
   ```
   *(If the `where` conditions (user is assignee, task is pending) are not met, the `then` clause will not execute, effectively preventing unauthorized completion.)*
