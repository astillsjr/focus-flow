# response:

Based on the provided description of Concept Design and the specific mention of `UserAuthentication`, here's a set of test cases designed for its specification.

The goal is to ensure the `UserAuthentication` concept behaves as expected, adhering to the principles of concept design such as independence, focused purpose, and state richness (but not *over*-richness).

***

## Concept Specification: `UserAuthentication`

Before generating tests, let's briefly define the inferred "spec" for the `UserAuthentication` concept based on the text:

* **Purpose:** To manage user identities and authenticate users.
* **State:** Maps user identifiers (e.g., `UserId`) to usernames and their corresponding hashed passwords.
  * `users: Map<Username, { userId: UserId, hashedPassword: String }>`
  * `userIdCounter: Integer` (to ensure unique `userId` generation)
* **Actions:**
  * `register(username: String, password: String)`: Attempts to create a new user account.
  * `authenticate(username: String, password: String)`: Attempts to verify user credentials.
  * `changePassword(username: String, oldPassword: String, newPassword: String)`: Allows an authenticated user to change their password.
* **Outputs (from actions):**
  * `register`: Returns `UserId` on success, or an error (e.g., "Username taken").
  * `authenticate`: Returns `UserId` on success, or an error (e.g., "Invalid credentials").
  * `changePassword`: Returns `true` on success, or an error (e.g., "Invalid old password", "User not found").

***

## Test Cases for `UserAuthentication`

Each test case describes a scenario, the action performed, and the expected outcome in terms of the concept's state changes and return values. These tests explicitly *do not* involve other concepts like `Session` or `Profile`, maintaining the `UserAuthentication` concept's independence.

### Test Category 1: User Registration

**1.1. Successful Registration of a New User**

* **Scenario:** A user attempts to register with a unique username.
* **Given:** The `UserAuthentication` concept's state is empty (no registered users).
* **When:** The `register("alice", "securePassword123!")` action is invoked.
* **Then:**
  * A new entry is added to the `users` state: `alice` maps to a newly generated `userId` (e.g., `user-001`) and a hashed version of "securePassword123!".
  * The action returns `user-001` (the new `userId`).

**1.2. Registration with an Already Existing Username**

* **Scenario:** A user attempts to register with a username that is already taken.
* **Given:** The `UserAuthentication` concept's state contains `alice` (e.g., `user-001`, hashed "securePassword123!").
* **When:** The `register("alice", "anotherPassword")` action is invoked.
* **Then:**
  * The `UserAuthentication` concept's state remains unchanged (no new user or password update for `alice`).
  * The action returns an error indicating "Username already taken".

**1.3. Registration with Username Case Sensitivity (Design Decision)**

* **Scenario:** Test how the concept handles usernames that differ only by case.
* **Given:** The `UserAuthentication` concept's state is empty.
* **When:** `register("Alice", "pass1")` then `register("alice", "pass2")` are invoked sequentially.
* **Then (Assuming case-sensitive usernames, which promotes independence and avoids hidden complexity):**
  * Two distinct users are added to the state: `Alice` (e.g., `user-001`, hashed `pass1`) and `alice` (e.g., `user-002`, hashed `pass2`).
  * Both actions return their respective `userId`s.
* **Then (Alternative: If usernames are intended to be case-insensitive, this would be a different concept or a sync rule):**
  * The first `register("Alice", "pass1")` succeeds, creating `user-001`.
  * The second `register("alice", "pass2")` fails, returning an "Username already taken" error, and `user-001`'s password is NOT changed.

### Test Category 2: User Authentication (Login)

**2.1. Successful Authentication**

* **Scenario:** A registered user provides correct credentials.
* **Given:** The `UserAuthentication` concept's state contains `alice` (e.g., `user-001`, hashed "securePassword123!").
* **When:** The `authenticate("alice", "securePassword123!")` action is invoked.
* **Then:**
  * The action returns `user-001` (Alice's `userId`).

**2.2. Authentication with Incorrect Password**

* **Scenario:** A user provides a correct username but an incorrect password.
* **Given:** The `UserAuthentication` concept's state contains `alice` (e.g., `user-001`, hashed "securePassword123!").
* **When:** The `authenticate("alice", "wrongPassword")` action is invoked.
* **Then:**
  * The action returns an error indicating "Invalid credentials".

**2.3. Authentication with Non-Existent Username**

* **Scenario:** A user attempts to authenticate with a username not present in the system.
* **Given:** The `UserAuthentication` concept's state contains `alice`.
* **When:** The `authenticate("bob", "anyPassword")` action is invoked.
* **Then:**
  * The action returns an error indicating "Invalid credentials".

**2.4. Multiple Users Authentication**

* **Scenario:** Verify that multiple distinct users can register and authenticate independently.
* **Given:** The `UserAuthentication` concept's state contains `alice` (`user-001`, hashed "passA") and `bob` (`user-002`, hashed "passB").
* **When:** `authenticate("alice", "passA")` and `authenticate("bob", "passB")` are invoked.
* **Then:**
  * `authenticate("alice", "passA")` returns `user-001`.
  * `authenticate("bob", "passB")` returns `user-002`.

### Test Category 3: Password Management

**3.1. Successful Password Change**

* **Scenario:** A user provides their current correct password and a new password.
* **Given:** The `UserAuthentication` concept's state contains `alice` (e.g., `user-001`, hashed "securePassword123!").
* **When:** The `changePassword("alice", "securePassword123!", "newStrongPass456!")` action is invoked.
* **Then:**
  * The `hashedPassword` for `alice` in the state is updated to the hashed version of "newStrongPass456!".
  * The action returns `true` (success).
  * Subsequent `authenticate("alice", "securePassword123!")` should fail.
  * Subsequent `authenticate("alice", "newStrongPass456!")` should succeed.

**3.2. Password Change with Incorrect Old Password**

* **Scenario:** A user attempts to change their password but provides an incorrect current password.
* **Given:** The `UserAuthentication` concept's state contains `alice` (e.g., `user-001`, hashed "securePassword123!").
* **When:** The `changePassword("alice", "wrongOldPass", "newStrongPass456!")` action is invoked.
* **Then:**
  * The `hashedPassword` for `alice` in the state remains unchanged.
  * The action returns an error indicating "Invalid old password".
  * Subsequent `authenticate("alice", "securePassword123!")` should still succeed.

**3.3. Password Change for Non-Existent User**

* **Scenario:** An attempt is made to change the password for a username that doesn't exist.
* **Given:** The `UserAuthentication` concept's state contains `alice`.
* **When:** The `changePassword("bob", "anyOldPass", "anyNewPass")` action is invoked.
* **Then:**
  * The concept's state remains unchanged.
  * The action returns an error indicating "User not found" or "Invalid credentials".

***

### Implicit Assumptions / Design Decisions Reflected in Tests:

* **Password Hashing:** Passwords are never stored in plain text. The concept handles the hashing internally.
* **Unique User IDs:** Each registered user gets a unique identifier generated by the concept.
* **Atomic Actions:** Each action fully completes its operation or fails, leaving the state consistent.
* **"No richer than it need be":** The state *only* includes what's necessary for authentication (user ID, username, password hash). No profiles, emails, session tokens, etc.
* **Independence:** No test relies on the existence or behavior of any other concept. The `UserAuthentication` concept stands alone in these tests.

These tests provide a comprehensive set for verifying the core functionality of the `UserAuthentication` concept as described, emphasizing its modularity and independence.
