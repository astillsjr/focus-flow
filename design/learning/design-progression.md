# Context Issues

I was having issues with the Context application, as for whatever reason it would not provide any useful code even when I linked all the background documents. So given that I ended up writing all the implementations and tests myself, there are no interesting moments captured from context. Some of my thoughts on standout moments were recorded in the changelog files associated with each concept.
