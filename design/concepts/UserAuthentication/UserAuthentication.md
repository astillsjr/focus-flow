# concept: UserAuthentication

* **concept**: UserAuthentication
* **purpose**: To authenticate users so that each personâ€™s data is securely associated with their identity and protected from unauthorized access.
* **principle**: If a user registers with a username and password, then later logs in using those same credentials, the system recognizes them as the same user, enabling access to their personalized FocusFlow data. If they log out, their session ends and their private data becomes inaccessible until they log in again.

    * a `username` of type `String`
    * a `hashedPassword` of type `String`

    * a `refreshToken` of type `String`
